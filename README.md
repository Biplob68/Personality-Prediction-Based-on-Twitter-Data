#### The aim of this project is to predict the personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism based on Twitter usage data and to determine the best models to predict the personality.      
This study applies the personality prediction of a Twitter user based on the words used in tweets posted by the user. The personality type is predicted based on the Big Five Personality Model and outputs are agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism, and extraversion as personality traits. To predict each personality trait, most successful machine learning methods are selected.
